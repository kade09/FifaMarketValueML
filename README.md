This was a group Project for COGS 118A at UCSD. Final version available in FinalProject_group028.ipynb branch

Description:

  Helping Football Clubs invest in buying players by predicting their market values. Building ML models using Ordinary Least Squares(OLS) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) based on numerical and categorical data including goals, assists, marketability, position, and nationality. 

Format: 

  Python notebook. Used Python for general coding. Pandas, statsmodels, NumPy, scikit-learn packages/libraries for data cleaning, preprocessing, and ML analysis. Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizations.
